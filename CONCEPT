# Concept Brief

Creating a 3D tower defense game, similiar to that of Dungeon Defenders. Player will be allowed to roam around a map, looking for chests 
which contain MP, MP is used by the player to construct towers (Hopefully upgrade and repair too). The player has a set time to set up defenses
before the combat phase, whilst the combat phase is active, a series of monsters will spawn who will attempt
to destroy the crystal.

## Outline for first version
Player who can spawn in a turret/can auto attack
Run a combat phase
Monsters who will attack the crystal
A spicy UI/HUD
