# Summative
|2017| My final project for Grade 12 Computer Science. Going for a Dungeon Defenders style game, you have a build phase, 
where the player goes around the map collecting some sort of currency and using that currency, has to set up defences, then
there's the combat phase where monsters spawn and try to attack some sort of object on the map. Read the CONCEPT file for the Concept Brief.
